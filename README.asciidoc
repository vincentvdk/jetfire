== jetfire

An Ansible inventory tool.

=== Overview
Jetfire is a web based Flask application with a MongoDB backend to manage an Ansible inventory.

It is currently in early stage and lacks fearures and proper documentation. It currently has the 
following features:

* add host with vars and add it to available groups
* add groups with vars and available members
* get host info (hostvars)
* get group info (groupvars and members)
* edit host vars and groups
* edit groups vars and hosts
* remove hosts and groups from the inventory

=== Usage

You'll need a running MongoDB instance that you will use for your inventory. By default an "ansible" db is created (unless you configure a differend name in the config file) with currently following collections

* hosts
* groups

clone the repository and edit the config.cfg file in the +app+ folder (specify mongodb server, port and database). Then run python app.py to launch the application.
Open a browser and point to http://<yourhost>:5000

The +inventory.py+ script is used as inventory script. It must be edited to point to the same MongoDB instance and database to function.

=== TODO
* list required Python packages
* enable versioning in MongoDB
* easier search
* REST API
