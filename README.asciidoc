* add groups with vars and available members
* get host info (hostvars)
* get group info (groupvars and members)
* edit host vars and groups
* edit groups vars and hosts

=== Usage

You'll need a running MongoDB instance and create a DB that you will use for your inventory.

clone the repository and edit the config.cfg file in the +app+ folder (specify mongodb server, port and database). Then run python app.py to launch the application.
Open a browser and point to http://<yourhost>:5000
